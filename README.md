What I've made for university term project 2017/fall.

I remember I used Android Studio for this project.

As it was my first time using Kotlin so project structure/code might be messy.

This app won't work without a backend server running ML with some specifications.

Also, a compiled Unity project was included, which is in assets/bin/Data.

That Unity project was developed in another repository, but I won't reference it here as it was developed by the team not my own.

Here's a short video showing the working app: https://youtu.be/uTGALQZ-n4w
